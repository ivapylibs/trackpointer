Implementations of trackpointer methods. Track object by giving track point or track coordinate frame.

## installation instruction

```
git clone git@github.com:ivapylibs/detector.git
pip3 install -e detector/
```

The test files are shell command line executable and should work when
invoked, presuming that pip installation has been performed.  If no
modifications to the source code will be performed then the ``-e`` flag
is not neessary (e.g., use the flag if the underlying code will be
modified).
